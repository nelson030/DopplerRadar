# Introduction

This is a simple React Application that utilizes client-side rendering. This app is built to track Doppler Radar activity.

I used React-Leaflet and OpenStreetMap for loading the map itself.
I used RainViewer API to load the doppler weather data.

## Features

- The page will show doopler radar activity for the whole globe
- The page will auto center on clients' location if (or once) browser location is enabled
-

## Future Feature Considerations

Utilizing RainViewer Features:

- Adding different map features
- Adding infrared satellite data (to show cloud formation)

Other Features:

- Update mobile experience
- Looping through data (Playing forecast continuously)
- Saving Previous data to display more data
  - Is it possible to show forecast for further in future?
